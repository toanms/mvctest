                        <p>The Skoolbo Spiral Learning Algorithm is designed to give every child the optimal curriculum regardless of his or her actual age. It starts by pre-testing the child in both literacy and numeracy and then continues to reassess after each game. An ideal blend of new content; not yet mastered content; and revision content is served to each child.</p>
                        <p>Many teachers have indicated that this inbuilt differentiation is one of the strongest features of Skoolbo.</p>
                        <p>Parents and teachers also have the ability to customise the program and set specific curricula for their children.</p>
                        <p>It’s all about the Improvement!</p>
                        <p>Improving educational outcomes is at the core of everything we do at Skoolbo. It is our reason for being and we are nothing short of obsessed with it. Skoolbo may look and feel like a game, but every component has the underlying rationale of maximising student improvement. Importantly, Skoolbo is a learning company that uses games as the central medium for learning. It is not a gaming company that simply adds some learning.</p>
